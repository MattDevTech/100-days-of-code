# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: May 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 3.5 hours of coding. Base meme generator working

**Thoughts:** I haven't logged in a while but I have coded for at least an hour every day. I posted several days on twitter even when I didn't log them here. The past several days I've spent my time working on the meme generator assessment for Springboard. It started off fine and I had the JS logic working relatively easily. Getting the CSS to work correctly though was a nightmare. Finally I learned that the reason I couldn't get the text to overlay on top of the image properly is because to get an element to use position: absolute the parent element must have a position on it as well(it can't just be static). If the parent element doesn't have a position on it then the child will base the absolute positioning on the first parent element it can find that has a position. Even if it has to go all the way to the top HTML element. Once I had that figured out it was pretty easy. I'm 6 hours into it and I still need to really work on the design of the page so it looks good but all the functionality is there now.

### Day 4: May 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 2sh hours of coding & videos today.   

**Thoughts:** Good quality today but not enough quantity. I did do the exercise to build a page that changes color based on where the mouse is on the page and I'm super proud I did that with almost no help. Googled some methods for syntax but that's it really. Was really excited about it. I'm going to get a good 6 hours in tomorrow!

### Day 3: May 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 4-5 hours of coding & videos today. Learned about eventListeners and working more with the DOM. There's a good exercise I'm going to start with tomorrow about changing the background color of the site based on where the mouse is.  

**Thoughts:** Much better day today than yesterday but still short of the 6-8 hours I'm going for. Tomorrow I'll be getting up early to start on coding first thing. I'm hoping getting going early instead of planning on going late will help me keep things going. Getting momentum going in the morning should help.

### Day 2: May 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Just a single hour of videos and some minor actual coding. 

**Thoughts:** Today I just got in a single hour. Was really out of sorts today and just couldn't get into it until late tonight. Still pulled it out and did some learning though. Went through several more videos on DOM manipulation and learned about get/setAttribute and some of the fields that we have direct access to like value and class. I think the first thing tomorrow will be working on a code-along where we modify classes using javascript and .classList.toggle to modify how things look on a page. I'm looking forward to a good night's sleep tonight and hitting things hard tomorrow.

### Day 1: May 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked through some timer/callback/setInterval exercises and did some DOM manipulation. The first callback exercise(countdown timer) taught me that sometimes the solution is much simpler than I'm making it out to be. The second exercise went great and I worked through it and debugged several issus on my own which is a huge confidence booster. The DOM video and exercise went great as well. 

**Thoughts:** Overall my biggest challenge is focusing for long periods of time, not the challenge of the code itself. I find that after about 2 hours I get antsy and need to get up and take a break. I need to work on both being able to sit and focus for longer and taking shorter breaks. Currently my breaks last an hour or more which limits how much coding I can do in a day. I expect this will ease over time as I get use to my new routine.
