# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked through some timer/callback/setInterval exercises and did some DOM manipulation. The first callback exercise(countdown timer) taught me that sometimes the solution is much simpler than I'm making it out to be. The second exercise went great and I worked through it and debugged several issus on my own which is a huge confidence booster. The DOM video and exercise went great as well. 

**Thoughts:** Overall my biggest challenge is focusing for long periods of time, not the challenge of the code itself. I find that after about 2 hours I get antsy and need to get up and take a break. I need to work on both being able to sit and focus for longer and taking shorter breaks. Currently my breaks last an hour or more which limits how much coding I can do in a day. I expect this will ease over time as I get use to my new routine.
