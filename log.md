# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: May 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 4-5 hours of coding & videos today 

**Thoughts:** Much better day today than yesterday but still short of the 6-8 hours I'm going for. Tomorrow I'll be getting up early to start on coding first thing. I'm hoping getting going early instead of planning on going late will help me keep things going. Getting momentum going in the morning should help.

### Day 2: May 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Just a single hour of videos and some minor actual coding. 

**Thoughts:** Today I just got in a single hour. Was really out of sorts today and just couldn't get into it until late tonight. Still pulled it out and did some learning though. Went through several more videos on DOM manipulation and learned about get/setAttribute and some of the fields that we have direct access to like value and class. I think the first thing tomorrow will be working on a code-along where we modify classes using javascript and .classList.toggle to modify how things look on a page. I'm looking forward to a good night's sleep tonight and hitting things hard tomorrow.

### Day 1: May 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked through some timer/callback/setInterval exercises and did some DOM manipulation. The first callback exercise(countdown timer) taught me that sometimes the solution is much simpler than I'm making it out to be. The second exercise went great and I worked through it and debugged several issus on my own which is a huge confidence booster. The DOM video and exercise went great as well. 

**Thoughts:** Overall my biggest challenge is focusing for long periods of time, not the challenge of the code itself. I find that after about 2 hours I get antsy and need to get up and take a break. I need to work on both being able to sit and focus for longer and taking shorter breaks. Currently my breaks last an hour or more which limits how much coding I can do in a day. I expect this will ease over time as I get use to my new routine.
